			<h5>Micro-Sites</h5>
			<p>A Microsite is comprised of an individual page or a
cluster of pages. Microsites are particularly useful if your business offers a variety of products or services and you want to highlight one segment for your customers. The Microsite ensures thought leadership in a particular discipline and can be a permanent place to showcase the product, or a temporary site during a product launch or promotion. A Micro-site exists to cater to a very specific context</p>

			<h5>Premiere Webinars</h5>
			<p>Our editorial team will facilitate lively debate and discourse in our monthly premiere webinars, featuring DevOps practitioners and topics chosen by the DevOps editorial staff.
